### Steps to configure the code and get it working
1) Clone the workspace
2) cd to the directory when you have cloned the codebase
3) ```sudo apt-get update```
4) ```sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev```
5) ```virtualenv myprojectenv```
6) ```source myprojectenv/bin/activate```
7) ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

### Update broker values
By default the code assumes that you have setup redpanda in your localhost. Incase you are setting up
redpanda in a docker/mac environment. You will need to update the parameter ```REDPANDA_BROKER_IP``` in the ```.env``` file
